# Reddit Quote Bot

Reads all comments in selected subreddits and compares their comments to famous quotes. On a close match, replies with the full quote, crediting the original author.

I'm live! Check out what I've been up to on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/redditQuoteBot/comments/).

## Overview

The bot periodically requests comments from selected subreddits, sorted by newest submissions. Each comment, is compared for similarity to a dataset of [quotes](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abireltaief/english-quotes) using [spacy](https://spacy.io/). If a high similarity is detected, a reply is generated and posted as a response to the original comment.


## Running a bot instance

### Using Python

The package is available on [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/redditquotebot/), it can be installed with:

```bash
pip install redditquotebot
```

A Spacy language model is also needed for natural language processing. Testing is conducted with `en-core-web-md`:
```bash
pip install https://github.com/explosion/spacy-models/releases/download/en_core_web_md-3.4.1/en_core_web_md-3.4.1-py3-none-any.whl
```

Generate the configuration and credential templates in the current directory (see reference below):
```bash
reddit_quote_bot.py -g
```

Start up the bot:
```bash
reddit_quote_bot.py
```

### Using Docker

Currently, the only option is to build the container from source. Eventually, this will be pushed to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/).

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/etdds/redditQuoteBot.git
cd redditQuoteBot
```

Build the docker container:
```
make build-image
# or
docker build -t etdds/reddit-quote-bot:latest .
```

Start up the bot. The configuration and credential templates are generated on the first run. Populate these files then restart the container.
```
# Initial run to generate configuration
docker run -v $(pwd):/home/app_user/run etdds/reddit-quote-bot

# Run the container, detached, restarting unless stopped.
docker run --restart unless-stopped -d -v $(pwd):/home/app_user/run etdds/reddit-quote-bot
```

The mounted directory is used to store the configuration files, credentials, comment and reply records and state.

## Runtime file descriptions

The bot uses four files during runtime, these are created and stored in the directory from where the bot is started.

### Configuration

The configuration file `configuration.json` is created the first time is run, and read once on startup.

### Credentials

The credentials file `credentials.json` is created the first time is run, and read once on startup. Currently, this means the credentials are stored in plain text. This should be changed.

The fields for the `reddit` object are identically named, and passed directly to [Praw](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html). See Praw's documentation [here](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/authentication.html).

```json
{
  "reddit": {
    "user_agent": "",
    "client_id": "",
    "client_secret": "",
    "username": "",
    "password": ""
  }
}
```

### Records 

The record file, `records.json` is automatically generated and updated during the bots runtime. A minimum example would look like:

#### Comments Section

Contains a log of all comments fetched which meet the minimum length criteria, have not been edited, and are not part of the author blacklist.

#### Matches Section

Contains a log of all comments and quotes which matched with a score above the `match_store_threshold` score.

#### Replies Section

Contains a log of all replies which have been sent (or just logged if `reply_to_comments` is set to false). These are generally matches with a score above `reply_threshold`.

#### Banned Subreddit Section

Contains a list of subreddits which the bot thinks it is banned from. This is determined by receiving a forbidden exception when trying to post a reply.

### Bot State

The current state of the bot is stored in an autogenerated file `scrape_state.json`. Currently, this only keeps a log of the latest comment timestamp in UTC for each subreddit queried.

```json
{
  "latest_comments": {
    "worldnews": 1667877818.0,
    "science": 1667877772.0,
    "AusFinance": 1667877814.0,
    "news": 1667877770.0,
    "ShowerThoughts": 1667877860.0,

    }
}
```

## Development

The repository is setup to use VSCode with the remote development plugin. Everything should be self-contained within this environment.

Contributions and suggestions welcome. Open and an issue or formulate a pull request.
